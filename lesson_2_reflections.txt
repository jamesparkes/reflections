What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Running 'git init' creates a .git folder in your directory that contains all the metadata in order to keep track of your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where files are held before being committed as changes. This is different from the working directory and repository because in the staging area you can pick and choose what files need to belong. The working directory contains all the files in the directory you are currently in and the repository contains all the files in the entire project.

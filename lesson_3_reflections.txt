When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When sharing your project with others. By hosting a project on a service like GitHub, then other people can access your repository and contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are collaborating with other people, then pulling changes automatically could break whatever you have staged and are working with inside your local repository.
